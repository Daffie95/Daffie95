#Welcome!

## About me

My name is Patrik, and I am currently a 27 year old Data Center Engineer with expertise in Fiber Optics Infrastructure. During the pandemic I was enrolled as a Full Stack Developer Student.
Sadly, due to the pandemic and circumstances I had to drop off the course and have not had the chance to continue it. However, now that the pandemic is mostly over and my life is back on smoother tracks
I plan to resume a creative passion for code. 
<br>
I'm a enthusiastic food person who's got multiple years of restaurant experience, and even more years feeding people I love with the food I dreamt of creating. There is a high 
chance many of my projects will be centered around food, or tools to help you, simply put, create a better food experience for yourselves and your loved ones.
<br>
As you can see, my Git repo's are quite empty for someone who's been a Full Stack Student. That's because I thouroughly believe in clean slates for maximum potential. It's been a few years
since I studied code and I want it to be from myself and because of myself. 

## Im Currently Working On:
There's a few ideas I've always had on my mind that I would have liked to work more on. Simplistic softwares that improves the experience of cooking for people that struggle with nailing it down.
Wether it's about the time perspective, health or even cost. 

### **Casually Amazing**
Casually Amazing is my little baby dragon that's been brooding in my head for about 8 years. With the regrets that I didnt start sooner, I realized that I dont need the perfect idea 
to create a way for myself to build a successfull project. Jumping on the ideas in your head is atleast 50% of the progress of the entire project. 
*Casually Amazing* is what every food website I've always wanted, it's simplistic, interesting, and sleek, but also smart. With helpful functions to take your food game to new levels, or just bring it up to line with your needs. I do not want this to become a top-end niche that is only used by chefs's or very experienced home cooks. 
<br>
I enjoy writing, I will dive deeper into my writing ambitions later. I plan to do posts. So the application/website needs to be able to store, view and preview posts. In line with content being displayed I would like to be able to supply a wide range of different recipes. *This* is a brief idea of how I want to create **Casually Amazing**

### **Writing Idea Generator**
I enjoy writing, quite a lot actually. However, one of my main struggles with writing is having a few too many ideas, and procrastinating the energy to dive away. If the struggle of having to choose goes away, so does the possibility to procrastinate. To me, this feels like a
